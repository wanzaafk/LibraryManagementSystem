# Library Management System Database

## Description

This project implements a relational database schema for a Library Management System using MySQL. It models books, authors, members, loans, and their relationships, enforcing data integrity through primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

## How to Set Up

1. Install MySQL or use any MySQL-compatible database environment.
2. Import the `library_management.sql` file:
   - Using MySQL CLI:  
     ```bash
     mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < library_management.sql
     ```
   - Or use MySQL Workbench / phpMyAdmin to run the SQL script.
3. The script creates all tables with constraints ready for use.
