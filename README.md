# Library Management System Database

## Project Description

This project is part of my Database Design and Normalization assignment. The goal is to design and implement a relational database for a Library Management System using MySQL, applying the principles of good database design and normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF).

The database models key entities of a typical library, including:
- **Books**
- **Authors**
- **Members**
- **Loans**

The schema enforces data integrity using primary keys, foreign keys, and appropriate constraints, ensuring proper relationships between entities.

## Contents of this Repository
